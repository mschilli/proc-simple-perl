    Proc::Simple CHANGES
######################################################################

          1.32 (2015/11/15)
            (ms) [rt.cpan.org #108215] open() calls now use the safe form.

          1.31 (2012/11/17)
            (ms) To better deal with the race condition in the 
                 previous release, kill the newly created child 
                 process first, then send a killpg to its process 
                 group and ignore the outcome.

            (ms) [RT 81203] Jim A Kessler reported a perl 5.16 issue
                 with the "AutoLoader" line, so I went ahead and removed
                 all references to "Exporter" and "AutoLoader", as 
                 Proc::Simple isn't using them at all.

          From 1.29:
                     [RT 69782] Zefram reported race condition in t/sh-c.t,
                     fixed by adding polling loop.

                     Found that kill(-sig, pid) sometimes fails with 
                     'process id not found' although a previous kill(0, pid) 
                     succeeded. This is a race condition condition caused
                     by a newly forked child that hasn't called setsid() yet
                     and therefore its new process group id doesn't exist yet,
                     although the child responds to poll(). kill() now
                     deals with this case.
          From 1.28:
                     [RT 69103] Typo fix by Salvatore Bonaccorso
                     Added support for processes called via 'sh -c' by
                     system() (see "Shell Processes" note in the manpage).
          From 1.27:
                     [RT 62802] Pod fix by Salvatore Bonaccorso
                     [RT 63833] Applied patch to stop reaping PIDs of 
                       no longer existing processes (submitted by perlbotics).
                     Added licensizer
                     [RT 63833] (second part) Added cleanup() class method
                     to delete timing data of reaped processes, avoiding
                     infinite memory growth on long-running processes

          From 1.26: [RT 62285] Pod fix for redirect_output()
                     Fixed github link

          from 1.25: Localize special variables so that the exit status 
                     from waitpid doesn't leak out, causing exit status 
                     to be incorrect (RT33440, fixed by Brad Cavanagh).

          from 1.24: Added copyright header

          from 1.23: Applied doc patch by Janne Chr. Schulz

          from 1.22: Applied patch by Jeff Holt, providing start
                     and end time of the forked process via t0() and t1().

          from 1.21: Added patch by Chip Capelik to provide a wait()
                     method waiting for a process to terminate.

          from 1.20: Added patch by Tobias Jahn <tjahn@users.sourceforge.net>,
                     to redirect STDOUT or STDERR of the child process upon
                     request.

          from 1.19: Fixed bug which occurred on failed fork()s, as 
                     reported anonymously on the CPAN bug tracker.

          from 1.18: Added multi-arg start method (proposed by
                     Clauss Strauch <Clauss_Strauch@aquila.fac.cs.cmu.edu>)

          from 1.17: Fixed Version difference between Makefile.PL
                     and Simple by using VERSION_FROM (thanks
                     Andreas Koenig)

          from 1.16: Fixed bug with Proc::Simple instances which
                     were DESTROYED before they were ever started.
                     Many thanks to Russell Fulton (r.fulton@auckland.ac.nz)
                     for pointing this out.

          from 1.15: Added %DESTROYED hash for processes which might
                     still in zombie state right after their objects
                     went out of business. THE_REAPER will take care
                     of them.

          from 1.14: Added exit_status() method and a smart
                     REAPER which reaps only processes we've started before.

          from 1.13: Replaced two erronous uses of 'exists' by 'defined'.
                     Thanks to Rolf.Beutner@telekom.de for pointing this
                     out.
          from 1.12: To fight problems with zombies, replaced the wait()
                     function by a NOWAIT waitpid on systems that 
                     support it.

                     Tim Jenness <t.jenness@jach.hawaii.edu> included
                     kill_on_destroy/sig_on_destroy/pid methods.

          from 1.11: binkley's error: threw out waitpid, wait is
                     performed by signal handler now.

          from 1.1:  Process is now called Proc::Simple to fit in the
                     CPAN namespace, corrections Andreas Koenig suggested.

First Release:  05/22/96
