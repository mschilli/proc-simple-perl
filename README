Module:   Proc::Simple.pm    Version 1.13 (02/21/99)

Author:   Michael Schilli

Description:   

          Proc::Simple helps controlling background processes in Perl. It 
          provides "Process Objects" that mimic their real world 
          counterparts. You don't have to deal with fork and wait and 
          friends, Proc::Simple is very easy to use, you just start 
          processes in background, poll their status once in a while and 
          kill them if necessary. 

          Proc::Simple is reportedly used in monitoring applications that 
          fire up external programs, or software that batch processes user 
          programs by launching them in parallel in order to put constant 
          load on an expensive number-crunching machine. 

Synopsis:       
          use Proc::Simple;

          $myproc = Proc::Simple->new();        # Create a new process object

          $myproc->start("shell-command-line"); # Launch a shell process
          $myproc->start(sub { ... });          # Launch a perl subroutine
          $myproc->start(\&subroutine);         # Launch a perl subroutine

          $running = $myproc->poll();           # Poll Running Process

          $proc->kill_on_destroy(1);            # Set kill on destroy
          $proc->signal_on_destroy("KILL");     # Specify signal to be sent
                                                # on destroy

          $myproc->kill();                      # Kill Process (SIGTERM)

          $myproc->kill("SIGUSR1");             # Send specified signal

          Proc::Simple::debug($level);          # Turn debug on

Changes:       
          from 1.12: To fight problems with zombies, replaced the wait()
                     function by a NOWAIT waitpid on systems that 
                     support it.

                     Tim Jenness <t.jenness@jach.hawaii.edu> included
                     kill_on_destroy/sig_on_destroy/pid methods.

          from 1.11: binkley's error: threw out waitpid, wait is
                     performed by signal handler now.

          from 1.1:  Process is now called Proc::Simple to fit in the
                     CPAN namespace, corrections Andreas Koenig suggested.
