Module:        Proc::Simple.pm    Version 1.13

Author:        Michael Schilli

Description:   Proc::Simple helps controlling background processes. It 
               provides "Process Objects" that mimic their real world
               counterparts.

               A Process object can be activated, i.e. the corresponding
               process can be started either with a shell-like 
               command line or by specifying a perl subroutine. The
               'start' Method of the process object is non-blocking, i.e.
               it returns immediately and runs the specified process in 
               background mode. Every process object provides a 'poll' method 
               that tells if the corresponding process is still running 
               and the 'kill' method can be used to finally terminate it
               or send and arbitrary UNIX-signal.

Logic:       
               use Proc::Simple;

               $myproc = Proc::Simple->new();        # New process object

               $myproc->start("sleep 10");           # Start Shell process
           OR
               $myproc->start(sub { sleep 10; });    # Start Perl Sub

               print "alive!\n" if $myproc->poll();  # Poll Process

               $myproc->kill("SIGUSR1");             # Send signal
               $myproc->kill();                      # Terminate 


Changes:       
               from 1.12: To fight problems with zombies, replaced the wait()
                          function by a NOWAIT waitpid on systems that 
                          support it.

                          Tim Jenness' <t.jenness@jach.hawaii.edu> included
                          kill_on_destroy/sig_on_destroy/pid methods.

               from 1.11: binkley's error: threw out waitpid, wait is
			  performed by signal handler now.
               from 1.1:  Process is now called Proc::Simple to fit in the
                          CPAN namespace, corrections Andreas Koenig suggested.
